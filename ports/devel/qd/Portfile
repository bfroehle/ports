description     C++/Fortran-90 double-double and quad-double package
long_description \
    This package supports both a double-double datatype (approx. 32 decimal \
    digits) and a quad-double datatype (approx. 64 decimal digits). The \
    computational library is written in C++. Both C++ and Fortran-90 \
    high-level language interfaces are provided to permit one to use \
    convert an existing C++ or Fortran-90 program to use the library with \
    only minor changes to the source code. In most cases only a few type \
    statements and (for Fortran-90 programs) read/write statements need to \
    be changed. PSLQ and numerical quadrature programs are included.
