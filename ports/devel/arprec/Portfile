description     C++/Fortran-90 arbitrary precision package

long_description \
    This package supports a flexible, arbitrarily high level of numeric \
    precision -- the equivalent of hundreds or even thousands of decimal \
    digits (up to approximately ten million digits if needed). Special \
    routines are provided for extra-high precision (above 1000 digits). The \
    entire library is written in C++. High-precision real, integer and \
    complex datatypes are supported. Both C++ and Fortran-90 translation \
    modules are also provided that permit one to convert an existing C++ or \
    Fortran-90 program to use the library with only minor changes to the \
    source code. In most cases only the type statements and (in the case of \
    Fortran-90 programs) read/write statements need be changed. Six \
    implementations of PSLQ (one-, two- and three-level, regular and \
    multi-pair) are included, as well as three high-precision quadrature \
    programs.
