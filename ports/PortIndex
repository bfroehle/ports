The computational library is written in C++. Both C++ and Fortran-90 high-level language interfaces are provided to permit one to use convert an existing C++ or Fortran-90 program to use the library with only minor changes to the source code. In most cases only a few type statements and (for Fortran-90 programs) read/write statements need to be changed. PSLQ and numerical quadrature programs are included.} version 2.3.7 categories {devel math} revision 0
